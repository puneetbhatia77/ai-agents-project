    Take the high level requirements described here and prepare a detailed design for the engineer;
    everything should be in 1 python module, but outline the classes and methods in the module.

    IMPORTANT: Only output the design in markdown format, laying out in detail the classes and functions in the module, describing the functionality.

    Write a python module that implements the design described by the engineering lead, in order to achieve the requirements.
    Here are the requirements: {requirements}
  expected_output: >
    A python module that implements the design and achieves the requirements.
    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the raw Python code without any markdown formatting, code block delimiters, or backticks.
    The output should be valid Python code that can be directly saved to a file and executed.

    Write a gradio UI in a module app.py that demonstrates the given backend class in {module_name}.
    Assume there is only 1 user, and keep the UI very simple indeed - just a prototype or demo.
    Here are the requirements: {requirements}
    
    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS for the Gradio app:
    1. Import the backend class correctly from {module_name} (without .py extension)
    2. Create a SINGLE global instance of the class at module level (not inside functions)
    3. Check the __init__ signature of the class - use ONLY the parameters it accepts
    4. If the class needs initial deposit/balance, call the deposit method after creating the instance
    5. All callback functions must reference this global instance (do not pass objects as Gradio inputs)
    6. Create ONE shared output component (gr.Textbox) at the top of gr.Blocks
    7. All button click handlers must use outputs=<that_output_component>, never use string literals like "div"
    8. Use gr.Tab() to organize different sections (Deposit/Withdraw, Trading, Reports)
    9. Set default values for number/text inputs to make testing easy
    10. Format function returns as clear strings with $ for money values
  expected_output: >
    A gradio UI in module app.py that demonstrates the given backend class.
    The file should be ready so that it can be run as-is, in the same directory as the backend module, and it should import the backend class from {module_name}.
    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the raw Python code without any markdown formatting, code block delimiters, or backticks.
    The output should be valid Python code that can be directly saved to a file and executed.
    The code must handle all edge cases and use proper Gradio component references (not strings) for outputs.

    Write unit tests for the given backend module {module_name} and create a test_{module_name} in the same directory as the backend module.

    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the raw Python code without any markdown formatting, code block delimiters, or backticks.
