My name is Puneet Kumar Bhatia. I'm a Solution Architect, software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Ambala, but I moved to Bangalore in 2013.
I love all foods, particularly Indian food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of Non-veg. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste!
Cricket is my favorite sports.
